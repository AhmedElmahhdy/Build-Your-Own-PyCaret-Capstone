# Capstone Project Overview
In this capstone project, participants will engage with PyCaret, an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python designed to automate machine learning workflows. The primary aim is to create a general package that simplifies data handling and streamlines the machine learning process.

## Objectives
- Explore PyCaret to understand its functionality fully. This includes learning how to load data, conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA), train various machine learning models, evaluate their performance, and utilize PyCaret's AutoML feature to efficiently identify the best machine learning model for specific datasets.
- Develop a general machine learning package that enables users to load data, perform EDA, and train machine learning models. The package should also automatically decide whether to use regressors or classifiers based on the data and allow users to select the models they wish to train.
- Use Streamlit to create a user-friendly web app. Streamlit, a Python library, simplifies the creation of interactive web apps. The web app should enable users to upload their data, select the target variable, and choose the machine learning models they want to use.
## Criteria
- The package must effectively load any data, perform EDA, and train machine learning models. It should also automatically select the correct type of model (regressor or classifier) for the data.
- The Streamlit web app should facilitate an easy and interactive way for users to upload their data, select a target variable, and choose which machine learning models to use.
- The package and web app should be thoroughly tested across various datasets to ensure they consistently identify the best machine learning model for each dataset and are free of errors.
- Participants should demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of PyCaret by effectively applying its features in the package, especially the AutoML functionality for optimal model selection.
- Clear documentation and guidelines for using the package and web app should be provided to ensure users can fully utilize all available functionalities.
